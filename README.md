# TicTacToe
This is a basic game of tic-tac-toe, where two players take turns pressing buttons in a 3x3 grid to mark “X” or “O” characters on them respectively. If any player can place three of their letter in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, that player wins the game. Two players are playing on the same screen; the first tap is an X move, the second is an O move, and so on.
